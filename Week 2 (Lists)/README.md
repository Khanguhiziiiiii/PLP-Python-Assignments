# Python List Operations

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding an index.

## Steps Performed

1. Create an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Append elements `10, 20, 30, 40`.
3. Insert `15` at the second position (index 1).
4. Extend `my_list` with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Remove the last element from the list.
6. Sort the list in ascending order.
7. Find and print the index of the value `30`.
